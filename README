Usage: ACCESS_KEY=foo ./longlat.py 127.0.0.1

Returned data looks like this:

  Latitude:34.0453 Longitude:-118.2413

From a security perspective, it would be a bad idea to hard-code the API Access key in here,
hence reading it from the environment. These are viewable via /proc/self/environ, but are
considered fairly secure.


   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if IP address not supplied as the only arg

       2      if ACCESS_KEY environment variable is not supplied

       3      if an error status was returned by the API

       4      if longitude is not present in the API response

       5      if latitude is not present in the API response

Building the docker container, within the directory of the checked-out repo:
